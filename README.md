# E-Waste-AICTE
This project aims to develop an AI-powered image classification system that automatically identifies and categorizes different types of electronic waste (e-waste) using machine learning techniques.

By leveraging deep learning, specifically the EfficientNetV2B0 architecture, the model can classify e-waste images into categories such as PCB, batteries, keyboards, wires, mobile phones, and more. The solution promotes smarter e-waste management by enabling automated sorting at recycling centers, reducing manual effort and improving recycling efficiency.

The model is trained on labeled image data using data augmentation techniques, and its performance is visualized using training and validation accuracy graphs. The final trained model is saved and can be used for real-world prediction tasks or deployment in smart recycling systems.
